Reading Material
----------------

### Reading Material

-   Free Software/Open Source: Information Society Opportunities for
    Europe?
    -   <http://eu.conecta.it/paper.pdf>
-   Brief history of open source software
    -   <https://bit.ly/2Vxs0vw>

A (Very) Brief History of Linux
-------------------------------

### The Main Characters

-   East Coast (MIT) Richard Stallman launched the GNU project -- under
    GNU General Public License (GPL) - Stallman\'s manifesto:
    -   Stated that availability of source code and freedom to
        redistribute and modify software are fundamental rights.
-   West Coast (UC Berkeley) was improving the UNIX system BSD Unix --
    supported by DARPA

### More from the West Coast

-   BSD Unix released under BSD License. Kernel requires AT & T Unix
    license -- hence remained proprietary.
-   Another important Open Source Project is TeX (a typesetting system
    by Donald Knuth - Stanford)
-   Communities for all of them exist even today

### Communities

-   USENET newsgroups and communities formed.
-   They were able to patch programs and development was possible,
-   X windows (Open Source) funded by consortium of companies.

### UNIX Kernel

-   Bill Jolitz (UCB) was developing kernel for i386 under Net/2 (free
    of the copyright form AT&T) -- 386 BSD
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Jolitz>
-   Linus Torvalds (Finland) -- unhappy with Prof. Tannenbaum\'s minix
    kernel was implementing linux kernel with GNU software.
-   386 BSD evolved into NetBSD, FreeBSD, OpenBSD
-   Linux Kernel evolved into many GNU/Linux distributions (Slakware,
    Debian, Red Hat and many more)

### More High Quality Open Source Development

-   Apache (Widely used WWW server)
-   Perl, (an interpreted language with lots of libraries --
    bio-informatics)
-   R (origin in AT&T Used by Statisticians and Data Analysts)
-   Mozilla/Firefox -- WWW Browser (origin Netscape)
-   GNOME/KDE -- Desktop Environment -- Used for nonspecialists

### More \...

-   Python, Java, GO -- Programming Languages
-   Open Data
-   Open Research -- Making the data and computations Public
